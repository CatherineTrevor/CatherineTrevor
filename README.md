As at November 2021, I received a Diploma with Merit from the Code Institute, with the following project grades;

[Project One: Gothenburg Netball Club](https://github.com/CatherineTrevor/gothenburg-netball) - **pass**

[Project Two: Help Trevor Grow!](https://github.com/CatherineTrevor/help-trevor-grow) - **merit**

[Project Three: Lead Generation Calculator](https://github.com/CatherineTrevor/lead-generator-calculator) - **distinction**

[Project Four: The Marketing Ally](https://github.com/CatherineTrevor/the_marketing_ally) - **merit**

My history is in marketing, with over 15 years in various roles, mainly database management and lead generation. My goal is to bridge the gap between the business knowledge and principles of marketing, and the amazing world of data and automation!

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any projects where I can learn more, and practice coding, in particular Python!
