As at May 2021, I have passed my first module, waiting for results on my second, and in the process of studying the connection between Pyhton and SQL, before preparing for my third project.

Check out my first and second projects here:

[Project One: Gothenburg Netball Club](https://github.com/CatherineTrevor/gothenburg-netball)

[Project Two: Help Trevor Grow!](https://github.com/CatherineTrevor/help-trevor-grow)

My history is in marketing, with over 15 years in various roles, mainly database management and lead generation. My goal is to bridge the gap between the business knowledge and principles of marketing, and the amazing world of data and automation, through the wonder that is coding!
