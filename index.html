                Bridging the gap between the commercial focus and principles of marketing, and the power and efficiency generated by data and automation.
            </h5>
            <h5 class="fst-italic">
                After more than 15 years in marketing roles for predominantly B2B organisations, including eight years at a leading provider of factory automation, I took the chance in 2020 to study software development and enhance 
                my qualifications in a complementary skill.

            <h5 class="fst-italic">
                With a key interest in data and an analytical approach to work, I improve decision-making in marketing to ensure it is strategically focused and increases value through continuous improvement and cross-functional collaboration.
